## What is Breadcrumbs?

Education stands as a pivotal force in socioeconomic mobility.
Yet, generational barriers outside of an individual's influence hinder a person's access to educational opportunities.
Breadcrumbs represents [OASCI's](https://www.oasci.org/) initiative to fundamentally transform access to educational materials, embodying the spirit of discovery and the sharing of knowledge fragments that have traditionally been accessible only through the goodwill of others.
Breadcrumb websites are freely accessible resources, and we encourage contributions, improvements, and adaptations so long as they abide by the terms outlined in the [CC BY-NC-SA 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/) license.
