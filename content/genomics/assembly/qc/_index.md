HTS machines read thousands or millions of sequences in parallel.
As you can imagine, this usually generates large `fastq` files, with millions of lines.
Manually inspecting the quality of each read is out of the question.
Specialized software has been developed to provide quality measures for `fastq` files generated by HTS machines.

[FastQC](./fastqc/) is a popular program to generate quality reports on `fastq` data.
In fact, this is usually the first thing you should do once you receive a new dataset.
[FastQC](./fastqc/) reports provide a series of plots that allow the user to assess the overall quality of their raw data and detect potential biases and problems.
