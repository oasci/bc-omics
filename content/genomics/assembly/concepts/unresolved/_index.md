Unresolvable repeats pose a significant hurdle in genome assembly, as they create ambiguity in determining the correct order and arrangement of DNA sequences.
The key strategy employed to handle unresolvable repeats involves essentially leaving them out of the assembly.
This approach is crucial for ensuring the accuracy and reliability of the assembled genome.

Unresolvable repeats have a profound effect on the assembly process, leading to the fragmentation of the genome.
When faced with unresolvable repeats, the assembly algorithm breaks down the genetic sequence into smaller, manageable fragments.
This fragmentation is a necessary step to navigate the complexities introduced by repeats and ensures a more accurate reconstruction of the genome.
