Most sequencing platforms require DNA fragments of specific sizes:

-   **Enzymatic fragmentation**: Employs restriction enzymes or non-specific endonucleases to cleave DNA at defined sites or randomly.
-   **Mechanical shearing**: Includes methods like sonication or hydrodynamic shearing, which produce random fragments.
-   **Tagmentation**: A more recent method that combines fragmentation and adapter ligation in a single step using transposase enzymes.

The choice of fragmentation method depends on the sequencing platform and the desired fragment size distribution.

## Size Selection

To ensure optimal sequencing performance, DNA fragments must be within a specific size range:

-   **Gel electrophoresis**: Fragments of the desired size are excised from agarose gels.
-   **Bead-based methods**: Magnetic beads with size-selective binding properties are used to isolate fragments of interest.
-   **Microfluidic systems**: Automated platforms that can precisely select fragments based on size.
