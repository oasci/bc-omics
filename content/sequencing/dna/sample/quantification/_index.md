Accurate quantification and quality assessment of the extracted DNA are crucial:

-   **Spectrophotometric methods**: UV absorbance at 260 nm is used to quantify DNA, with the 260/280 nm ratio indicating purity.
-   **Fluorometric assays**: Dye-based methods (e.g., PicoGreen) offer higher sensitivity and specificity for double-stranded DNA.
-   **Gel electrophoresis**: Provides information on DNA integrity and can detect contamination by RNA or degraded DNA.
