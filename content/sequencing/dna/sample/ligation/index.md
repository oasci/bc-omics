These steps prepare the DNA fragments for sequencing:

-   **End repair**: Converts overhangs to blunt ends and ensures 5' phosphorylation for efficient adapter ligation.
-   **A-tailing**: Addition of a single adenine nucleotide to the 3' ends of blunt-ended fragments (for some platforms).
-   **Adapter ligation**: Attachment of platform-specific adapters to the DNA fragments, enabling amplification and sequencing.
