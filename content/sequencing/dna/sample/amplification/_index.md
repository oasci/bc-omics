Many sequencing protocols require amplification of the adapted DNA fragments:

-   **PCR amplification**: Selectively amplifies fragments with correctly ligated adapters.
-   **Emulsion PCR**: Used in some platforms to amplify DNA on beads in isolated microdroplets.
-   **Bridge amplification**: An solid-phase amplification method used in some next-generation sequencing platforms.
