Final assessment of the sequencing library is crucial:

-   **qPCR**: Provides accurate quantification of amplifiable fragments.
-   **Bioanalyzer or TapeStation analysis**: Assesses fragment size distribution and library concentration.
-   **Sequencing QC**: A small-scale sequencing run may be performed to validate library quality before full-scale sequencing.
