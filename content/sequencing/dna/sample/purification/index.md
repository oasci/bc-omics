Following cell lysis, the released DNA must be separated from other cellular components and purified.
The choice of detergent and lysis conditions can impact these downstream processes, influencing the purity and quality of the final DNA sample.

## Protein removal

Proteinase K digestion is commonly used to degrade proteins, including nucleases that could damage the DNA.

## RNA elimination

RNase treatment may be employed to remove RNA, which can interfere with downstream applications.

## Organic extraction

Phenol-chloroform extraction is a classical method for separating nucleic acids from proteins and lipids.

## Solid-phase extraction

Silica-based methods, often in column format, allow DNA to bind selectively under specific pH and salt conditions.
